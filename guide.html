       <p class="guidestext">Welcome to the Tech Community Guides! Whether you're a beginner or an experienced tech enthusiast, our easy-to-follow guides are designed to help you with every step of building, upgrading, or maintaining your computer. From identifying the right components to installing and troubleshooting, we've got you covered with practical tips and step-by-step instructions.</p>
        <div class="basics">
          <h3>The basics</h3>
          <h5>Motherboard</h5>
          <li>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all the components of a computer. It allows the CPU, RAM, storage, and other parts to communicate with each other. Think of it as the foundation of your PC.</li>
          <h5>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h5>
          <li>The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, handles all the instructions your computer receives. The speed and performance of your computer largely depend on the power of the CPU.</li>
          <h5>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h5>
          <li>RAM is temporary storage that your computer uses to store data that is currently being used. The more RAM your PC has, the better it can multitask and handle complex processes without slowing down.</li>
          <h5>Storage (HDD/SSD)</h5>
          <li>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) or Solid State Drives (SSDs) store all your data, including your operating system, applications, and files. SSDs are faster and more reliable than HDDs, making them a preferred choice for modern PCs.</li>
          <h5>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h5>
          <li>The PSU provides power to all the components of your PC. It's important to have a PSU that can supply enough power for all the parts in your system, especially if you’re running high-performance components like a powerful GPU.</li>
          <h5>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h5>
          <li>Also known as the video card, the GPU is responsible for rendering images and videos. While many CPUs come with integrated graphics, dedicated GPUs are essential for tasks like gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering.</li>
          <h5>Cooling System</h5>
          <li>A cooling system (usually fans or liquid cooling) prevents your CPU and GPU from overheating by dissipating heat. Proper cooling is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing damage to your components.</li>
          <h5>Case</h5>
          <li>The case houses all the components of your PC and protects them from external damage. Cases come in various sizes and designs to suit different builds and preferences.</li>
